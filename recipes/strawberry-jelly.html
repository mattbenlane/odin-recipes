        <h2> Information</h2>
        <p>British strawberry jelly is a fruit-flavored gelatin dessert, similar to what is known in the United States as Jell-O. 
            Not a jam or fruit spread as the term "jelly" might indicate in the States, British jelly is a beautiful, fruit-forward, and refreshing 
            dessert that can take elaborate forms and be decorated with intricate fruit arrangements. Home cooks usually make this common dessert 
            using a store-bought concentrated flavored gelatin block, which 
            requires only to boil some waterâ€”similar to making powdered Jell-O.</p>
